    <title>NLP Experiment bot</title>

    <p>
        We are running an experiment to learn how news on different topics originate and spread
        across the Web. Then we will rank content sources based on originality, timeliness and
        coverage. If you are a creator of original content you will benefit from the service
        because we will link extensively to your resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bot adheres to the best crawling practices. We read robots.txt file and follow the instructions.
        If there is no craw-delay instruction we use 10 seconds (actual interval could be much longer
        since we use LRU algorithm to visit different resources). We parse sitemaps first if they
        exist, and we could skip your site entirely if there are no sitemaps.

        If you have any questions or complaints, please write to vbаybеkоv@gmаil.соm (type it, do
        not copy this piece since it contains cyrillic symbols). However, we will not stop
        crawling your site unless you adjust your robots.txt file. We believe that if you put
        something online you want other people to see it, and our service is made to help people
        find what they need in a timely and precise manner - to theirs, yours and ours benefit.
